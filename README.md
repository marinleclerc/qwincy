## Plugin Installed

Thoses plugins can be updated realy easilly by using packages manager.
Just remove them in the package.json and run `yarn`.
To install them, just run `yarn add + plugin-name`
Comment or uncomment them in main.js :)

# Getting Started

# Important 

## Install Dependencies

## Create the client project in Gitlab
- Create a new project in Make the Grade Group in Gitlab
- Name it properly
- Let all the default options checked

## Import the boilerplate ( you are at this step )

```
git clone [url .git https du boilerplate]
```

- Rename the folder
- Sync your code with your repo by using this command :

```
git remote set-url origin [url .git https du nouveau repository]
```

- In the project settings > repository > protected branches ( expand ) > Unprotect the "main" branch

- Deploy your code on master branch 

```
git push -uf -origin main 
```

## Install all project dependencies

Run in the project root:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Setup Hubspot Configuration

### Package.json

- Update the name of your project
- Change your env portal

```
  "env": {
    "dev": "mtg-dev-antoine",
    "prod": "mtg-dev-antoine"
  },
```

For example you have to change your ```mtg-dev-antoine``` to your new project portal name.

- Auth on your hubspot portal using the official documentation

```
yarn hs:auth
```

** BE CAREFULL, THE KEY USED DURING THIS COMMAND MUST BE THE SAME AS THE ONE USED IN YOUR PACKAGE.JSON **

### Update all the naming

src/theme.json -> Update label
src/templates -> Update blog-listing / blog-post + pages/multi-purpose.html + pages/landing-page.html  + system/*
Rename all mtg-hubspot-boilerplate by the name of the project

### Configure auto-deployment

- In the deploy-file.sh file, modify the line number the line by indicating the name of your dev portal and the name of the project
- Deploy a first time to make sure of the good parameter setting by executing the command yarn deploy:dev | yarn deploy:prod
- Go to the portal -> Create a first page by selecting the theme previously renamed in the code base.


To develop continuously, run the following command in a first terminal.  This command will activate a watch on css and javascript.

```
yarn start
```

To activate the watch on your modules and templates, execute the following command in a second terminal in parallel.

```
watchman-wait . --max-events 0 -p 'src/modules/**/*.json' 'src/modules/**/*.html' 'src/templates/**/*.json' 'src/templates/**/*.html' | while read line; do ./deploy-file.sh $line; done
```

### SASS Management

- Start creating the style guide accorded to your project by updating function.scss

## Developing new modules

Use the command `yarn hs:module <name> src/modules` to create a new module. This will create a new folder in the modules folder. This folder contains the following files:

```
/fields.json
/meta.json
/module.css
/module.html
/module.js
```

Don't use the module.css and module.js files of a module. We only use the src/js folder and src/scss folder to edit css and javascript. More info : https://github.com/bradhave94/HubSpot/wiki/Custom-Modules-JSON

### Settings

Every module contains a meta.json file. This file contains properties with settings for the Hubspot module:

```
{
  "css_assets": [ ],
  "external_js": [ ],
  "global": true,
  "help_text": "",
  "host_template_types": [ "PAGE" ],
  "js_assets": [ ],
  "other_assets": [ ],
  "smart_type": "NOT_SMART",
  "tags": [ ],
  "is_available_for_new_content": true
}
```

To be able to use the new module in the Hubspot templates you should edit the meta.json file and change is_available_for_new_content to true.

If you need a global module, you can edit the property global and set it to true.

### Fields

Each module contains a `fields.json` file. This file contains all the fields a Hubspot user can edit to change the content of the module.

This boilerplate includes various fields utils `(/src/utils)`. Create a `/fields/fields.js` file in each module. Use this file to list which utils and custom fields should be used to build up a `fields.json` file (see Gulp buildModuleFields).

Example fields.js:

```
exports.config = function() {
  return [
    'src/modules/example.module/fields/content.json',
    'src/modules/example.module/fields/image.json',
    'src/utils/fields/padding.json',
    'src/utils/fields/mobile_padding.json'
  ]
}
```

#### Basics of Github - Skip this part if you're familiar with Git

##### About

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)

Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.

In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind.

##### Feature Branch Workflow

One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users.
Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase. When a developer wants to start working on something—no matter how big or small—they create a new branch. This ensures that the master branch always contains production-quality code.

Using feature branches is not only more reliable than directly editing production code, but it also provides organizational benefits. They let you represent development work at the same granularity as the your agile backlog. For example, you might implement a policy where each Jira ticket is addressed in its own feature branch.

Here are the basic steps to start using feature branches in your project.

- Start on master
- Create a new feature branch
- Implement your changes on that branch
- Push the feature branch to your remote repo
- Create a pull request for your new changes

#### Github Workflow

##### Start on Master

When starting a new feature, I make sure to start with the latest and greatest of the codebase from the main development branch—this commonly referred to as master:

```
# switch to the master branch
git checkout master
# fetch the latest changes from the remote git repository
git pull origin master
```

This reduces complications of dealing with out-of-date code, and reduces the chances of merge issues.

##### Create a Feature Branch

Now, I create a local branch to house the changes required for the new feature.

Here again we are using the term ‘feature’ loosely. It’s a logical grouping of code and configuration changes to enable a new portion of the code, fix an issue, or improve existing code. The idea is to use your best judgement and to try to keep the scope of the changes limited to a single logical issue.

`git checkout -b new_super_feature_mtg`

This will create a new branch called new_super_feature_mtg and check it out. We can think of this new branch as a copy of master, because it was what we had checked out, and it keeps the contents just as they were. We can now make new changes in our new branch without affecting the master branch.

##### Modify Code

Now, we implement the new feature / bug fix. Work as you would normally, making small incremental changes and checking them into the local feature branch.

Use descriptive comments when adding new changes so the history of changes is easy to follow. They can still be short and succinct, but be clear.

One useful way to think about commit messages is that together they make up the recipe for your project. “Add linting to application code” or “Add minification step” are very clear explanations for what your code is doing.

Clear commits allow your team to stay up to date with what’s happening in the code-base. They keep others more informed about the changes being made. They also help when you are looking back at the history of the project (usually when you are trying to understand when a bug was introduced). Seeing clear commit messages in your git history can help you hone in on issues a lot more quickly. And, as your project and team grow it can be worthwhile to standardize on commit message content and format, similarly to how you might with coding styles.

##### Push Feature Branch to Remote

Ok, you are done with the implementation. You’ve checked and double checked the changes, and you are now ready to have them integrated into the main code base.

The first step of the review process is to push your feature branch to `origin`.

`git push origin new_super_feature_mtg`

##### Create Pull Request

With your feature branch now pushed, navigate to the project’s GitHub page (you could also check out hub which provides command line tools for working with GitHub, in this case hub browse would open the GitHub project page for you). On the main page, you should see a new little toolbar that shows your feature branch listed and asks if you want to create a pull request from it. So let’s do it!

![alt text](https://static.bocoup.com/blog/git-workflow/pr_option.png)

When creating a pull request (or PR, as they are known by all the cool kids these days), you want to summarize the changes being made for this new feature and give it a descriptive title.

You can reference existing issues or other PR’s by typing ‘#’ followed by the issue number or any word from the issue title. A little pop-up should help with picking the right issue number.
